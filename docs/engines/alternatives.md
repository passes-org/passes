# Alternatives to Pass Engines

The Passes Protocol is agnostic to Pass Engines. They just provide a user-friendly and relatively ubiquitous means of handling pass requests.

Users could instead choose:
- A browser/extension that offers native support for the `document.passes` ABI __and__ handles presenting and handling pass requests
- A hardware device that receives pass requests forwarded from a computer or phone for secure handling
- A self-hosted pass engine the user runs on their own hardware at home (still a pass engine in this case)
