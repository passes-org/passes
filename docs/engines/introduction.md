# Pass Engines

A **Pass Engine** is a web page that implements support for a set of pass request types. It knows how to interpret and present a rich view of pass requests it supports for users to review and handle.

Pass Engines aren't inherent to the core of the Passes protocol (see [Alternatives](./alternatives.md)), but rather a proposed application-level means of making pass request handling user-friendly and easy to support in a variety of environments.
