# The Passes Foundation

**The Passes Foundation** will maintain passes.org and the Passes protocol. It will host passes.org and docs.passes.org, and publish the `@passes/*` packages. It will be independent of Genesis XYZ, Inc., and will initially include Dan Scanlon, et al. We are currently seeking co-founding members.
