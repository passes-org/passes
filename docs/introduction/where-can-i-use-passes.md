# Where can I use Passes?

- Any secure web page via `@passes/polyfill`. No extension required
- (Coming soon) Any browser with the Passes extension. Supported on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari (Mac, iOS, iPadOS)
- (Coming Soon) Native applications on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, or Linux

Any developer can create a [Pass Provider](./what-are-pass-providers), so in addition to standalone web or native apps, it's possible to create built-in support for Passes in web browsers and operating systems.
