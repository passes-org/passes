# ABI

The core of the Passes protocol is the `document.passes.request` ABI.

Designed for:
- Core stability
- Request envelope versioning / ABI backwards compatibility
- Extension by you

## Request Envelope

- v0x00
- Requests and Results

## Standards built upon the ABI

Semantic information such as how to interpret the contents of a raw pass request are specified by standards that build upon the ABI.
