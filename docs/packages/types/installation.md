# Installing `@passes/types`

`@passes/types` provides type declarations related to the `document.passes` ABI and PRC-2 (FIXME: correct reference) interface.

Most developers will not use `@passes/types` directly, and will instead use `@passes/reqs`, which provides a high-level API for making pass requests using structured information.

## Installation

::: code-group

```[npm]
npm add -D @passes/types
```

```[yarn]
yarn add --dev @passes/types
```

```[bun]
